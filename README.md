## NM Medical Cannabis App

The motivation behind the NM Medical Cannabis app is the lack of information about the medical cannabis program in New Mexico, in particular, medical cannabis patients. The app intends to give patients a way to track the allocated units provided in a 90 day rolling period. 

NM Medical Cannabis app is useful because, as of this writing, patients do not have any way of tracking their units. 


Currently, the NM Medical Cannabis app has a login page, a patient card info page, and a transaction page. The login page, as of now, is a way to enter the app. The patient card info page is set up to add the number of the patient card, enter the issue and expiration of the card, and enter the patient's current units.

For the app to be in a state of readiness the app needs the following:
- Patient Card Info Page 
    -needs to an edit button to be able to change the issue date of your card. 
    -the units need to update as soon as a transaction has been logged.
- Transaction Page 
    -Needs to finish the calculation of units depending on the type of cannabis was bought.
    -Needs to be able to scroll through the history of transactions. 
    -Needs to add units back to available units  

Currently, the NM Medical Cannabis App developed on the Android OS platform version 5.0 â€“ 5.1.1, is using the Lollipop API level 21. 

It is tested using the Nexus 5X API 22 emulator and has no orientation restrictions of which I am aware. 

The aesthetics of NM Medical Cannabis app can improve with the following:
-A color scheme using no more than three colors. 
-Change fonts to a clear modern typeface and one accent font. 

Below is a list of stretch goals sorted by what would add the most utility at the top.

-A link to the NM health department to learn about the laws and regulations of New Mexico regarding NM Medical Cannabis.
-A link to the diagnosis you can use to apply.
-A download link to the application which is needed to apply to be considered as a patient. 
-A list of medical cannabis doctors who are certified to approve your application.
-A list of all dispensaries in the state of New Mexico.
-A profile page for doctors, dispensaries, and growers so patients can rate as they see fit.
